for monitroring the cpu usuage : 

run the command top in batch on linux OS for getting a snapshot of cpu statistics 
extract the ling containing CPU usuage information 
parse the idle percentage from this line 
calculate the active CPU usage
use the command printf to round the CPU usage value to the nearest whole number 
define CPU threhold value ( in our case 80%) that will trigger the alert 
print the current cpu usage percentage to the terminal 
compare CPU usage with the Threshold
using if statment for testing the CPU usage if it exceed the threshold create a log to /var/log/syslog using logger 
print the alert message to the terminal 
if the threshold not excced using else to print a message that indicating the CPU usuage is within normal limits 
after checking the script and it work insert it as a cronjob to cronjob -e for runing every X times 


there is another way to do it in linux OS , we can use python in linux to create service that always run in the systemd,for doing it we will need to create a systemd service file and insert our python script there 
then reload the systemd.
